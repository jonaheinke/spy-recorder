# Small spy recorder

## 1. Overview

**TODO**

**TODO: How long can it record?**

It can be powered from the outside for longer recording durations.

It can be controlled via Bluetooth Low Energy from a smartphone or tablet.

I chose the Arduino Nano RP2040, because it includes a microphone and Bluetooth module for communication. Otherwise they would have to be on a separate module board. **(TODO: is the Arduino 33 BLE an alternative?)**

It gives immediate user feedback via a RGB LED.

## 2. External ressources

- Arduino's [overview page](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-rp2040-connect) for its Nano RP2040 Connect (specs, pinout, datasheet, etc.)
